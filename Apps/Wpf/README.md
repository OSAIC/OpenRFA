The OpenRFA Desktop Application is a desktop application built on C# and WPF. This application is intdended to be a shared parameter manager which would make REST API calls to [OpenRFA.org]("http://openrfa.org") rather than reading and writing to a local shared parameter text file.

The short-term goal is to build an application using OpenRFA.org's REST API to help with development of the API itself. The hope is that while developing this application, we will build solid code samples as well as API documention.
